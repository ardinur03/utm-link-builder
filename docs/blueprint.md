- Accent color: Teal (#2A9D8F) to highlight key interactive elements like the generate button and copy to clipboard.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, neutral, and easily readable look.
- Use simple, geometric icons for actions like 'copy to clipboard' and to visually distinguish UTM parameters. Icons should be monochrome, in the accent color.

- Subtle animation feedback on button clicks (e.g., a gentle scale or color change).
